# 🔍 Text Description Investigation & Fix Summary

## 📊 Investigation Results

### Issue Identified:
**Problematic Text Description in Team Lead Role**

The Team Lead role in the experience section had a poorly formatted description that started with "Where I held diverse roles..." - this was an incomplete sentence fragment that made the CV appear unprofessional.

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Incomplete Sentence Structure**: The description started with "Where I held..." instead of a proper action statement
2. **Run-on Sentence**: Single long paragraph instead of clear bullet points
3. **Poor Professional Presentation**: Informal language structure for a professional CV
4. **JSON Formatting Issues**: Extra blank lines in the data structure

## 🛠️ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Rewritten Team Lead Description**
```json
// BEFORE:
"details": [
  "Where I held diverse roles such as Team Lead, Paralegal, Summon & Complaint, and E-file Clerk. My responsibilities encompassed assisting managers, collaborating on team development, overseeing teams, and ensuring the accuracy of legal documents. Prior to this, I held the position of Media Clerk, where I managed incoming mail and office documents."
